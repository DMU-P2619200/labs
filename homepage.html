<h1> About The 1975
</h1>
<p> Britain's ever-evolving the 1975 balance hooky dance-rock and adult contemporary sophistication with arty forays into electronica and Auto-Tuned pop. It was a sound they first debuted on 2013's The 1975, which brought them international stardom, topping the charts in the U.K. and reaching the Top 30 on the Billboard 200. While they have remained chart regulars, hitting number one with 2016's I Like It When You Sleep, For You Are So Beautiful Yet So Unaware of It, and number four with 2018's A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships, they have continued to experiment with their sound, embracing an ever-more genre-bending pop aesthetic.
Originally, the members of the 1975 met in 2002 while attending high school in Wilmslow, Cheshire, a suburb of Manchester. There, lead singer Matthew Healy, guitarist Adam Hann, bassist Ross MacDonald, and drummer George Daniel started out covering punk songs and playing at local all-ages shows before inevitably beginning to explore their own original material. In 2012, they released their first EP, Facedown, on the U.K. indie label Dirty Hit, and soon thereafter supported Little Comets on their nationwide tour. The lead track from the debut EP, "The City," was played on Huw Stephens' BBC Radio 1 show, and the quartet's energetic live performances endeared them to crowds, while their presence began to sweep across music blogs. Toward the end of 2012, the band released the Sex EP, and the title track was played by influential BBC Radio 1 DJ Zane Lowe.
